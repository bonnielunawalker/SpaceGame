# SpaceGame

SpaceGame is a simple team-based space combat simulation. The game was created as my custom program for Artificial Intelligence for Games.

# Features
 
 - Simple 2D vector graphics.
 - Force-based movement model.
 - Emergent state machines used for agent decision making.
 - Multiple ship classes with different targeting priorities (fighters will intercept bombers, cruisers will bombard large enemy ships)
